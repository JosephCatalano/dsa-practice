# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python.  Each project is well-documented and tested to demonstrate my understanding of computer science concepts and clean code practices.

## Concepts Covered

* ** Big O Notation:** A file ('big_o_examples.py') demonstrating and explaining Constant, Logarithmic, Linear, and Quadratic time complexities.

* **Dynamic Arrays:** A dynamic array built from scratch ('dynamic_array.py'), containing manual memory management, amortized O(1) appends, and a full test scenarios.

* **Algorithmic Patterns & LeetCode Solutions:**
    * A folder with optimal solutions for classic LeetCode problems like "Two Sum" (using a hash map) and "Valid Palindrome" (using two pointers).
    * Implementations of the Two Pointers pattern for problems like in-place array reversal (`two_pointers.py`).

* **String Manipulation:** A collection of functions for reversing strings, checking for palindromes, and counting character frequency (`string_manipulation.py`).

## How to Run

Each file can be executed directly from the terminal to run its test scenarios:

`python dynamic_array.py`
