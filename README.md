# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python.  Each project is well-documented and tested to demonstrate my understanding of computer science concepts and clean code practices.

## Concepts Covered

* ** Big O Notation:** A reference file ('big_o_examples.py') demonstrating and explaining Constant, Logarithmic, Linear, and Quadratic time complexities.

* **Dynamic Arrays:** A dynamic array built from scratch ('dynamic_array.py'), containing manual memory management, amortized O(1) appends, and a full test section.

* **Algorithmic Patterns:**
    * **Two Pointers:** Solutions for problems like in-place array reversal and finding a pair with a target sum (`two_pointers_solutions.py`).
    * **Hash Maps:** An optimal O(n) solution for the "Two Sum" LeetCode problem (`hash_map_solutions.py`).

* **String Manipulation:** A collection of utility functions for reversing strings, checking for palindromes, and counting character frequency (`string_manipulation.py`).

## How to Run

Each file can be executed directly from the terminal to run its respective test suite:

`python dynamic_array.py`
